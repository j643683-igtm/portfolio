Ultra-realistic industrial workshop background featuring a heavy-duty vertical drilling machine in idle position. 
The drill bit is stationary and positioned slightly above a clean metal workpiece clamped firmly on the machine table using steel T-slot clamps. 
The workshop environment includes concrete flooring, metal tool racks, control panels with analog gauges, safety signage, and soft ambient industrial lighting.
Subtle dust particles floating in the air, light reflections on metal surfaces.
The drilling machine shows realistic wear, oil stains, and machining marks.
Camera angle: slightly low front-left perspective to emphasize machine size and stability.
Depth of field: shallow background blur, sharp focus on drill bit and workpiece.
Color palette: cool industrial tones (steel gray, muted blue, dark green).
No motion blur. Calm, static, pre-operation atmosphere.
High detail, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio.
